## Main part
Implement a project in the Arkanoid genre - the player controls a platform that reflects the ball into the bricks located on the stage. When colliding with a brick, the brick is destroyed. When all the bricks are destroyed, the player is awarded a victory. If the player does not have time to catch the ball with the platform - defeat.
